        <p>Greetings young warrior. My name is Steve and it is my task to make a great warrior of you. In times gone by we would begin by strengthening your body, until it is a mortal weapon, after which we would focus on strengthening the mind that wields it, by teaching you skills in swordsmanship and other lethal weapons.</p>
        <p>However, times are changing and our order prides itself on changing with them. Noone fights with a sword these days and we must all either adapt, or perish. Behold, the latest in weapons technology. It is called a keyboard.</p>
        <p>Once you have typed 100 characters, you will have acquired both the strength to wield it, and the skills to master it.</p>
        <p>Begin!</p>
