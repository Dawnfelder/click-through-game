        <p>Congratulations on completing your training and welcome to <strong>The Order</strong>, brother!</p>
        <p>I must confess I had not expected you to complete your training so quickly. In fact many of our recruits don't survive at all. Very promising.</p>
        <p>Rest up tonight. I shall call upon you when the time comes for your first mission.</p>
