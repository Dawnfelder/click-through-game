        <p>Welcome, young adventurer. Tales have reached my ears of your deeds and of wise words you have spoken. You have proven yourself worthy of the teachings of <strong>The Order</strong>. All you need do is to choose your path. Choose wisely and know that all you have done thusfar no longer matters. Your past has fulfilled its purpose as it has brought you to this moment. Some stories start at the beginning - yours begins here.</p>
        <p>If you choose to become a <strong>Warrior</strong>, then you are choosing strength as the instrument with which you shall bring order and justice to any place in need.</p>
        <p>Should you choose the way of the <strong>Sorcerer</strong>, then you are choosing the pen over the sword and the staff over the lance. I realise that sounds a bit lame by comparison, but you get to do magic and stuff, so it's at least just as fun, I promise!</p>
        <p>You must also choose your name and, on a personal note, choose wisely or the other monks will choose for you and the teasing never stops...even if you become the greatest and most famous of the warrior monks.</p>
