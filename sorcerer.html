        <p>Greetings young sorcerer to be. I am Alan, Master Sorcerer and the one who shall oversee your training. You are probably asking yourself what magic I used upon you as you were entering my sorcerer's tower. Well I was embuing you with the energies required to work such magic. In order for you to access this new power of yours however, we must first strengthen your mind.</p>
        <p>I have prepared a mental exercise for you that is especially designed to do just that.</p>
        <p>Upon passing this test, the knowledge you will have acquired in doing so, will have sufficiently strengthened your mind.</p>
        <p>Begin!</p><br>
